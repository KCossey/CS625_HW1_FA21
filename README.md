Getting started - Due Sept 9  

### Sept 5, 2021
Completed all sections until Vega-Lite notebook. Observable notebook worked fine until I tried to download the png of the "fancy" weather chart. I can click 'Download png' and a file is downloaded, but it is 1 KB. Photos and Paint won't open it. Need to try on Edge or Chrome to see if Firefox issue.
